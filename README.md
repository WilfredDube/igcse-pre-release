The IGCSE Cambridge computer science syllabus (up to 2022) requires students to understand how to design a solution to a scenario-based question given a detailed problem statement and requirements (called tasks). In this series, Iâ€™m going to use the Computer Science pre-release material for the [November 2022 exam](https://papers.gceguide.com/Cambridge%20IGCSE/Computer%20Science%20(0478)/2022/0478_w22_pm_22.zip) to implement a solution to the given problem in Java.

This Java project stems from my decision to re-learn Java so I could use it professionally. The steps and decisions I took are  documented in this blog series: [**My Java journey**](https://unbusy.hashnode.dev/series/java-journey).
